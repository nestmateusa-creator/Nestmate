   ```

## What Each File Does

- **`autoblog-simple.html`** - Simple test version (start here!)

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click Generate"
- Make sure you selected both a topic AND an audience
- Check your browser's console (F12) for any error messages

### "Posts don't save"
- The system uses localStorage (browser storage)
- Make sure you're not in private/incognito mode
- Try refreshing the page

### "I want to see the full system"
- Start with `autoblog-simple.html` first
- Once that works, try `autoblog-manager.html`
- The full system has more features but is more complex
