You provided:
- ✅ Project ID: nestmate-167ed
- ✅ API Key: AIzaSyC7vRXVWl64DyBHywDOcRHAwm5Oij5G7yI
- ✅ Project Number: 865171535257

**Still needed:**
- App ID
- Measurement ID (optional, for Analytics)

## How to Get Your App ID:

1. **Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)**
2. **Select your "Nestmate" project**
3. **Click the gear icon** → Project Settings
4. **Scroll down to "Your apps" section**
5. **Look for a web app** (icon looks like `</>`)
6. **If you don't see a web app, click "Add app" → Web**
7. **Copy the App ID** (looks like: `1:865171535257:web:abc123def456`)

## How to Get Measurement ID (Optional):

1. **In the same Firebase Console**
2. **Go to Analytics** → Data Streams
3. **Click on your web app stream**
4. **Copy the Measurement ID** (looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

## Quick Alternative:

If you want to proceed without these details, I can use placeholder values and you can update them later. The app will still work for basic functionality.

1. Get the App ID and Measurement ID now
2. Proceed with placeholder values and update later
